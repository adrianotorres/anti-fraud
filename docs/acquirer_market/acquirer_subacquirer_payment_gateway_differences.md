## Acquirer, SubAcquirer and Gateway differences
**Acquirer:** As mentioned earlier, the acquirer is responsible for processing payments for a sale using credit and debit cards, facilitating the transaction between the merchant and the issuing bank. It handles communication with card networks, essentially acting as a card operations agent.

**Sub-acquirer:** Similar to an acquiring bank, the sub-acquirer plays a comparable role but with relative ease. It is not required to be affiliated with a banking institution or an acquirer to receive payments. The main advantage is its low implementation cost and ease of integration, making it popular for smaller stores. Also known as an intermediary, in the payment flow, the merchant sends transaction information to the sub-acquirer, which forwards this data to the acquirer. Upon approval, the sub-acquirer receives the sale amount, deducts its commission, and forwards the remainder to the merchant. It can also operate in different markets and have partnerships with acquirers, providing more flexibility.

**Payment Gateway:** It is a tool that acts as a kind of credit card terminal for e-commerce, where the customer provides purchase details on the checkout page. In other words, it is a platform that captures card information and sends it to the issuing bank for evaluation, checking if the buyer's data is secure and if there is sufficient balance to make the purchase.
