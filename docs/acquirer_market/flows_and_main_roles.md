# Acquirer Market!
In the acquirer market, there are two key flows to consider: the money flow and the information flow. Let's break down each of these flows:

### Money flow
-   **Cardholder to Merchant:** The money flow begins when a cardholder makes a purchase at a merchant using a credit or debit card. The merchant, also known as the seller or service provider, receives the payment from the cardholder for the goods or services provided.
    
-   **Merchant to Acquirer:** The merchant, after receiving the card payment, initiates the process of transferring the funds to their acquirer (also known as the acquiring bank or payment processor). The acquirer acts as an intermediary that facilitates the movement of money between the merchant and the cardholder's issuing bank.
    
-   **Acquirer to Card Network:** The acquirer, having received the funds from the merchant, communicates with the relevant card network (e.g., Visa, Mastercard). The card network facilitates the transfer of funds between the acquirer and the issuing bank.
    
-   **Card Network to Issuing Bank:** The card network forwards the transaction information to the issuing bank (bank that issued the credit or debit card to the cardholder). The issuing bank verifies the transaction, checks the cardholder's account for sufficient funds, and authorizes or denies the transaction.
    
-   **Issuing Bank to Acquirer:** If the transaction is authorized, the issuing bank transfers the funds to the acquirer, completing the financial transaction. The acquirer then credits the merchant's account with the sale amount, minus any fees.
    
-   **Settlement:** The final step in the money flow involves settlement between the various entities. Settlement is the process of exchanging funds and finalizing financial transactions between the acquirer, card network, and issuing bank.
### Information flow
-   **Transaction Information:** Throughout the money flow, transaction information, including details such as the purchase amount, merchant details, and cardholder information, is shared between the merchant, acquirer, card network, and issuing bank.
    
-   **Authorization:** The acquirer sends an authorization request to the issuing bank, seeking approval for the transaction. The issuing bank responds with an authorization or denial, and this information is communicated back through the acquirer and card network to the merchant.
    
-   **Clearing:** Clearing involves the exchange of transaction data between the acquirer and the card network, which then forwards the information to the issuing bank. This step ensures that the correct amount is transferred between the parties.
    
-   **Settlement Report:** A settlement report is generated, detailing the financial outcomes of the transactions. It includes information on funds to be transferred between the acquirer and the issuing bank, accounting for fees and adjustments.

## Main Roles


**Holder**: The customer who makes a purchase transaction using the card as a payment method at the service provider's Point of Sale (POS). They are responsible for paying the total sale amount, including intermediary fees, unless the entrepreneur absorbs these costs.

**Merchant**: The entrepreneur who offers products or services using an electronic payment system to receive the sale amount made by the cardholder.

**Acquirer**: Companies that capture payments, also known as acquiring banks. They accept different payment methods, acting as intermediaries for all credit and debit card transactions. Acquirers manage communication with card networks and issuing banks to validate information for transaction completion.

**Facilitator**: Payment facilitator companies may provide services similar to sub-acquirers, but they are not the same. The facilitator is a company that enables electronic payment transactions without dealing directly with the technical and security details involved in payment processing. They act as intermediaries between the buyer and the seller, facilitating the payment process.

**Card Network**: Companies responsible for defining business rules for purchases made with credit cards. They specify how acquirers should process transactions (each network has its standard). They identify the bank that issued the card anywhere in the world and send purchase information for authorization by issuers.

**Issuer**: Also known as the issuing bank, it is a financial institution responsible for providing credit or debit cards. In the payment process, they verify if the buyer has sufficient balance to complete a purchase, authorizing or denying the transaction and checking security factors during the operation. Upon confirmation, the issuer transfers the amount to the acquirer or grants credit, completing the cardholder's purchase.

**Regulator**: The Central Bank (BC) is the "sheriff" of all participants in the electronic payment market, not just banks. It regulates and supervises companies such as card networks or electronic payment acquirers, ensuring that each fulfills its role within the payment flow.
