## Chargeback 

Chargeback is a process where a consumer disputes a payment transaction with the card issuer (financial institution), requesting a refund of funds. The bank then contacts the acquirer that processed the payment for the involved e-commerce with the assistance of the card network. Ultimately, the acquirer notifies the involved company about the chargeback, demanding the amount that needs to be refunded to the consumer. The difference between chargeback and cancellation is that cancellation happens in a more amicable manner. Cancellation occurs when a consumer decides to cancel a purchase, and the retailer refunds the money directly to them, without involving the bank, acquirer, or card network. Therefore, while chargeback is a process initiated by the cardholder, often related to fraud, cancellation is an initiative of the consumer and can occur for a variety of reasons, without involving disputes between parties or financial losses for the retailer.

Payment reversals can occur for various reasons, including:

-   Undelivered product;
-   Unauthorized transaction;
-   Item delivered but not as described;
-   Processing or authorization error;
-   Defective product.

Chargebacks are closely tied to fraud in the acquiring world as they are often used to dispute fraudulent or unauthorized transactions. However, the misuse of chargebacks by some consumers can also be considered a form of fraud since it can result in financial loss for the establishment that conducted the transaction. Therefore, it is important for merchants to monitor their transactions and implement security measures to prevent fraud and reduce the likelihood of unwarranted chargebacks.
